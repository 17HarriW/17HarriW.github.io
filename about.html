        <h2 id="aboutTitle" class="title">Hi, I'm William Harris</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Year 13 student pursuing a passion for Computer Science, Mathematics, Further Mathematics,
            and Physics. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong affinity for software architecture and
            systems design. With a logical and critical approach at the core of my problem-solving process, I find joy in
            tackling complex challenges and creating innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>My life, so far:</h4>
        <p>
            My fascination with the world of design and coding began at a tender age of 7 when I joined a coding club.
            It was here that I experienced an immediate connection with the computational approach to problem-solving,
            which seamlessly blended with the logical workings of my mind. I transitioned from creating fun and interactive
            Scratch games to venturing into the world of web development using HTML and CSS, all before completing primary
            school. The ability to craft websites, visually appealing and functional, opened up new possibilities in my
            creative journey.
            <br />
            As I entered secondary school, my thirst for knowledge led me to Python, which fueled my passion for computer
            design even further. I found joy in constructing intricate programs and exploring the depths of software architecture.
            The culmination of my efforts came to fruition when I achieved outstanding results in my GCSEs. With flying
            colors, I secured an array of 9s (equivalent to A**) including Computer Science, Mathematics, and English Language.
            These accomplishments reinforced my belief in the path I had chosen and served as a testament to my dedication to the
            subjects I am truly passionate about.
            <br />
            Presently, during my A levels, my passion for computer science burns brighter than ever. I have expanded my
            repertoire to encompass a wide breadth of programming languages, including C#, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.
            Armed with this knowledge, I am now adept at creating software of remarkable quality, with the potential to be
            offered as marketable products.
        </p>
        <h4>Prgramming and Designing Software:</h4>
        <p>
            Programming is more than just a skill to me; it is a form of artistry. My ability to code allows me to breathe
            life into abstract ideas, transforming them into functional and elegant software applications. I revel in the
            process of architecting efficient and scalable systems, meticulously crafting code that not only works flawlessly
            but is also a joy to behold. I firmly believe that well-designed software is a testament to the intersection of
            creativity and engineering precision.
        </p>
        <h4>Personal Pursuits:</h4>
        <p>
            Beyond the world of programming and software design, I have a strong penchant for climbing. Scaling the heights
            of challenging routes teaches me valuable lessons in perseverance, problem-solving, and conquering fears. This
            spirit also extends to my personal life, where I find solace in spending quality time with friends, engaging in
            meaningful conversations, and creating lasting memories.
        </p>
