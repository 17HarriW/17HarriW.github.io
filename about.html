        <h2 id="aboutTitle" class="title">Hi, I'm William Harris</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Year 13 student pursuing a passion for Computer Science, Mathematics, Further Mathematics,
            and Physics. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong affinity for software architecture and
            systems design. With a logical and critical approach at the core of my problem-solving process, I find joy in
            tackling complex challenges and creating innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>My life, so far:</h4>
        <p>
            My fascination with the world of design and coding began at a tender age of 7 when I joined a coding club.
            It was here that I experienced an immediate connection with the computational approach to problem-solving,
            which seamlessly blended with the logical workings of my mind. I transitioned from creating fun and interactive
            Scratch games to venturing into the world of web development using HTML and CSS, all before completing primary
            school. The ability to craft websites that were visually appealing and functional, opened up new possibilities in
            my creative journey.
            <br />
            As I entered secondary school, my thirst for knowledge led me to Python, which fueled my passion for computer
            design even further. I found joy in constructing intricate programs and exploring the depths of software architecture.
            After finishing my GCSEs, I secured an array of 9s (equivalent to A**) including Computer Science, Mathematics, and
            English Language.
            <br />
            Presently, during my A levels, my passion for computer science is greater than ever. I have expanded my
            repertoire to encompass a wide breadth of programming languages, including C#, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.
            Armed with this knowledge, I am now more adept at creating software than ever and remain eager to learn and develop
            further.
        </p>
        <h4>Prgramming and Designing Software:</h4>
        <p>
            Programming is more than just a skill to me, my ability to code allows me to breathe life into abstract ideas, 
            transforming them into functional and elegant software applications. I revel in the process of architecting efficient
            and scalable systems, and I love crafting code that is not only functional but also visually appealing. I firmly 
            believe that designing software is a testament to the intersection of creativity and engineering precision.
        </p>
        <h4>Personal Pursuits:</h4>
        <p>
            Beyond the world of programming and software design, I thoroughly enjoy climbing, parkour/freerunning and spending
            quality time with friends. I love trying new things and as such, am very adaptable to change.
        </p>
        <h4>Thank you!</h4>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. It serves as a testament to my dedication, enthusiasm, and
            talent in the field of computer science and software design. As you explore this site, I hope you gain insights
            into my skills, experiences, and the creative mindset that drives me to put my passion into everything I do.
